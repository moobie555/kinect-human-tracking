# Background
This project aims at implementing an intelligent human resources management system which combines the RFID and face recognition method. The proposed system will have a camera to capture the faces of people and a RFID reader to check the ID numbers. If both of the verifying processes return a “Pass” signal, then a successful entrance signal is generated. The concept diagram of the system is described in figure 1.
